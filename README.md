# SummarAIze
Conducting comprehensive literature reviews is essential but time-consuming for researchers. This project explores the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate literature review and summarization. By training a model on a corpus of scientific papers, we develop techniques for extracting key information and generating concise summaries. The system identifies relevant studies, methodologies, and findings, streamlining the literature review process and supporting researchers in staying updated with the latest developments. 

This approach aims to save time and effort, enhancing the efficiency and quality of scientific research. Initial results demonstrate the system's ability to produce accurate and informative summaries, facilitating research advancements.

## Features
- **Automated Literature Review**: Extracts key insights from scientific papers.
- **Summarization**: Generates concise and informative summaries.
- **Relevance Identification**: Identifies relevant studies, methodologies, and findings.
- **Time Efficiency**: Saves effort in manually reading large volumes of literature.

## Technologies Used
### **Programming Language**
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

### **Libraries & Frameworks**
- [BART](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/bart) – Transformer-based summarization model
